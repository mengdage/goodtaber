# Introduction #
There are two kinds of actions defined in GoodTaber, searching and rearranging. They are mutually exclusive to each other. When you are searching you can not rearrange the tabs.

Searching includes searching by letters, by names and by creation time (function 5 and function 6).

Rearranging includes rearranging by dragging and dropping (function 4).
# Specification #
**4. Rearrange tabs by dragging items in the extensionâ€™s  popup.**

When you drag and drop a tab strip on the GUI, the tab will be rearranged in the browser correspondingly.

**5. Instant search.**

When you click the search icon, or just input some letter, the search box will show up and the result will be shown.
