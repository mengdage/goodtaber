# Communication #

One month is short for us to work on the project together. We have tried several methods to make our communication efficiently. These methods are listed as follows. They are arranged by frequency of being used.

  * messages
> > Since we don't live near each other, we usually send messages to discuss problems. It's very convenient and efficient.
  * face-to-face meeting
> > Every Monday, after the Open Source Class, we have a face-to-face meeting and discuss the project. It works as a conclusion of the week.
  * email
> > If we find some bugs or need code reviews, we will use email function provided by Google Code to inform others. It works very easily. When you finish your report, an email will be sent to involved members.
  * telephone
> > We make calls sometimes when we can not describe things correctly and need feedbacks immediately.
  * video meeting
> > Video meeting is a good way to communicate. But since there is always a better one, we only have tried once and never take it again.

In conclusion, sending messages is a very convenient method to communicate. Most time, we discuss through messages. Face-to-face meeting is the most efficient way, though it's not very convenient. Email and telephone are complemental methods.  Video meeting works like face-to-face meeting. However, it's not as easy as face-to-face meeting for us.

# Management #

We manage our project with the help of Google Code.

## Source Management ##

We use git provided by Google Code to manage our codes.

## Bug Management ##

We recode bugs and request code review in the Issues tab of Google Code.

The tools provided by Google Code is very useful. They provide great assistance for us to manage our project. One inconvenient thing is that we can not add pictures to wikis easily.
